# Dr-grow

This project was the hard work of my friends Akshay, Winnie & Vishnu 

hope you find our hard work useful.


## The project was developed in two stages:
1. Developing an image recogintion model using Python
2. Developing a frontend for user interaction using streamlit

The project features a Web app which helps users to identify various plants using an image of the plant's leaf.
currently due to lack of quality data we have limited the no. of classes to 7.
It also includes a chatbot powered using Ollama, which works offline. the supported models are llama3.2:1b and phi by microsoft

## For users who would like to use and develop my project:
the project uses the following libraries:
1. Streamlit
2. Tensorflow
3. Scikit-learn
4. Ngrok
5. ollama (models: Llama3.2:1b & phi) [Reference Link for Setting up](https://youtu.be/xZL-WQLodDE)
6. qrcode
7. Open-CV
8. matplotlib
9. Numpy
10. datetime
11. PIL
12. pandas

    #### PS: the project was developed on python 12.9 if u are having issues while running please try using the same version as Newer versions seemed to have issues with Tensorflow
